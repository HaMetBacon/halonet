# halonet

A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for generating mock dark matter halo catalog.

This is a 3D implementation of the [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) architecture (a [V-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797)).
It introduces some functionality allowing architecture variations and hyperparameter tuning.
It includes some tools for pre-processing of dark matter halo catalogs and analysis of the network's predictions.

For more details please see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04537).

Install the module with 

    python setup.py install
